Made the boxplots over time graphs for each city's sale prices, assessment values, and sales ratios. Helped to customize Megan's heat map to cover the same cities and variables. Cleaned data to exclude certain ineligible observations. Wrote short descriptions for the boxplot trends. (Can't remember anything else, if either of you remember additional feel free to add or delete)
